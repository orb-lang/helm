* Edit premise title

A simple, single-purpose raga for editing the title of a session premise.
This is ugly and really should be able to be generalized, but without a
proper raga stack it's the best we can do.


#!lua
local core_table = require "core:table"
local addall, clone = assert(core_table.addall), assert(core_table.clone)
local EditBase = require "helm:helm/raga/edit"

local EditTitle = clone(EditBase, 2)
EditTitle.name = "edit_title"
EditTitle.prompt_char = "ðŸ‘‰"
#/lua


** Keymaps and event handlers

#!lua
function EditTitle.accept()
   local title = EditTitle.agentMessage("edit", "contents")
   EditTitle.agentMessage("session", "titleUpdated", title)
   EditTitle.quit()
end

function EditTitle.quit()
   EditTitle.shiftMode("review")
end

EditTitle.keymap_extra_commands = {
   RETURN = "accept",
   TAB = "accept",
   ESC = "quit"
}
addall(EditTitle.keymap_extra_commands, EditBase.keymap_extra_commands)
#/lua

"Restart" doesn't make sense for us, so remove it from the keymap.

#todo should this maybe not be bound in EditBase to begin with? It'll be
shared between Vril and Nerf, but those could have an intermediate parent.

#!lua
EditTitle.keymap_extra_commands["C-r"] = nil
#/lua


** Quit handler

Quitting while editing a title still needs to prompt to save the session,
which we can handle by returning to review mode and retrying.

#!lua
local yield = assert(coroutine.yield)
function EditTitle.quitHelm()
   EditTitle.accept()
   yield{ method = "tryAgain" }
end
#/lua


#!lua
return EditTitle
#/lua
