* Helm acceptance testing

We have enough features now that it's easy for fixing one thing to break
another, and going through everything takes some time and it's easy to miss
things. This document is a plan/checklist covering all the major features to
provide at least a reasonable level of confidence that everything works.


** Basic operation

- [ ] Evaluate some basic expressions
- [ ] Evaluate some expressions that depend on stuff not in regular _G
- [ ] Use scrollback to review results from previous sessions and evaluate some lines
- [ ] Resize the window
- [ ] Open the "help" (hah!), scroll around, and close out of it


*** Autocomplete

- [ ] Enter autocomplete and cancel out of it
- [ ] Use autocomplete to build a dotted path
- [ ] Refine results by typing once something is selected in the suggestions area
- [ ] Assign a variable and autocomplete against it


*** Search

- [ ] Search for something
- [ ] Cancel out of search with ESC and by deleting the search string
- [ ] Scroll around with arrow keys, including wrapping around
- [ ] Accept a result with Return
- [ ] Accept a result with M-<n>



** Sessions

- [ ] Record and review a session using =br helm -n=
   - [ ] Use each premise status at least once
   - [ ] Give something a title
   - [ ] Move/reorder a premise
- [ ] Run the session with =br s= and make sure it passes
- [ ] Bring up session review again with =br helm -i= and make some changes,
  verify that they stick
- [ ] Answer "no" and "cancel" to the save-changes prompt and verify correct
  behavior


** Interactive restart

- [ ] Start helm with =-r= after a previous run
   - [ ] Verify tab order behavior
   - [ ] Insert a line--at the beginning, middle, end
   - [ ] Start to insert a line and cancel out of it
   - [ ] Trash a line
   - [ ] Evaluate and verify correct history
- [ ] Review an empty run (note, this is likely to become a separate option as
  we will want to ignore empty runs most of the time)
   - [ ] Starts with an "insert" line
   - [ ] Enter and cancel out of insertion, line is still there (unlike
     normally)
