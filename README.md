# Helm

Helm is "an REPL".  It is, naturally, a work in progress.

But then again, aren't we all.  Pull requests gratefully accepted.

It features an innovative "top mode" interaction paradigm, an incomplete but 
hopefully comprehensible command set, and a curated dark color scheme.

The knit code for `helm` is written in Lua, which will be changed by one letter
once Djikstra indexing and the new parser are complete.

History, and eventually "sessions", a combination of exploratory call-response 
interactive trial of new code, with a thereby saved unit test for the correct 
response to the calls in question, are kept in a SQLite database in 
`XDG_DATA_HOME`. 

We trust this willl greatly accelerate the production of software based on the
`bridgetools` suite of mutually-reinforcing artisinally crafted softwares.

The **source** code for `bridgetools` is written in Orb, a literate markup
language, which aims to complete the system of Knuth/Emacs idealism.

Much love, y'all.

Let's build the future.

cheers,
