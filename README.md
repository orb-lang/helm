# Helm

Helm is "an REPL".  It is, naturally, a work in progress.

But then again, aren't we all.  Pull requests gratefully accepted.

It features an innovative "top mode" interaction paradigm, an incomplete but hopefully comprehensible command set, and a curated dark color scheme.

The knit code for `helm` is written in Lua, which will be changed by one letter once Djikstra indexing and the new parser are complete.

History, and eventually "sessions", a combination of exploratory call-response interactive trial of new code, with a thereby saved unit test for the correct response to the calls in question, are kept in a SQLite database called `.bridge`.

We trust this willl greatly accelerate the production of software based on the `bridgetools` suite of mutually-reinforcing artisinally crafted softwares.

You're welcome by the way.

The **source** code for `bridgetools` is written in Orb, the repository for which I have already made public though I do need to push a branch or two.

Hol' on a second

There. Done.

### Things I would like done

Here is a non-exhaustive list of tasks you may complete if you get the gist of `.orb` and are in the mood to help out:

- A working "sessions" and suggestions for how to add them to `nerf` mode and `vril`

- As much of `vril` as you'd care to add

- Documentation including Anki deck(s) for spaced repetition for the use of same

- A completed `readline`-style nerf-mode system with another deck of the aforementioned Anki and docs, probably for the use of people who aren't me but you never know.

Hmm that'll probably do for now. Oh

- A light-mode and a way to choose palates more generally, store such ingenia as parsers for various `#!languages` `#/languages` as written in the soon-to-be completed `GGG` dialect for using `pegylator` (I'll push what I've got, promise. Next, even), in `.orb` based personal configuration files and other appropriate places.

Pull requests accepted though let's be real it might take me as much as a day to get around to code review.

Much love, y'all.

Let's build the future.

cheers,
